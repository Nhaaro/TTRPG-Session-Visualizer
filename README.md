WIP - README.md generated by GPT-4

## Overview

This tool is designed to assist with the organization, analysis, and management of log files. It features a user-friendly interface with several components, each serving a distinct purpose in log file processing.

## Features

### Tree View of Log Files

- Current Functionality: Provides a one-level deep tree view of log files, allowing users to quickly access and inspect logs.
- Planned Improvements: Implementation of multi-level tree view and virtual addition of files to enhance file navigation and management.

### Session Detection

- Current Functionality: Automatically detects log file sessions by analyzing timestamps, determining the specific day and hours of each session, and generating associated metadata.
- Planned Improvements: Aim to refine time parsing to account for varying formats and time zones.

### JSON Structure Recognition

- Current Functionality: Scans the entire log to identify and catalog JSON structures, making it easier to understand the data encapsulated in the logs.
- Planned Improvements: Enhancements to parsing algorithms to increase accuracy and handle complex nested JSON objects.

### Interactive Key-Value Display

- Current Functionality: Allows users to click on any key identified in the JSON structure section to reveal the associated values used during the cataloging process.
- Planned Improvements: Plans to add filtering and search functionality to simplify the retrieval of specific key-value pairs.
